         <p>The Magars, also spelled Mangar and Mongar, are a Tibeto-Burman ethnic group 
        native to Nepal and Northeast India,  representing 6.9% of Nepal's total population according 
        to the 2021 Nepal Census.They are one of the main Gurkha tribes. The first home of the Magars 
        was to the west of the Gandaki River and, roughly speaking, consisted of that portion of Nepal
        which lies between and around about Gulmi, Arghakhanchi, and Palpa. This part of the country was 
        divided into twelve districts known as Bahra Magarat(Confederation mof Twelve Magar Villages),
        which included the following regions of that peroid: Argha, Khanchi, Bhirkot, Dhor, Garhung, 
        Gahiring, Gulmi, Isma, Musikot, Rising, Satung, and Pyung. During the medieval period, the 
        whole area from Palpa to Rukum Rolpa was called the Magarat, a place settled and inhabited by
        Magars. Another confederation of eighteen Magar kingdoms, known as Athara Magarat, also existed 
        and was originally inhabited by Kham Magars.  </p>

        <h2>Geographical distribution</h2>
        <p>At the time of the 2021 Nepal census, 2,013,498 people (6.9% of the population of Nepal) 
           identified as Magar. The frquency of Magar people by province was a follows:</p>

           <li>Gandaki Province (18.8%)</li>
           <li>Lumbini province (14.6%)</li>
           <li>Karnali Province (10.4%)</li>
           <li>Bagmati Province(5.1%)</li>
           <li>Koshi Province (4%)</li>
           <li>Sudurpashchim Province (2%)</li>
           <li>Madhesh Province s(1.1%)</li>

        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>The Magar of the Bahra Magarat east of the Kali Gandaki River are said to have 
            originated in the land of Seem. Two brothers, Seem Magar and Chintoo Magar, 
            fought, and one remained in Seem, while the other left, ending up in Kangwachen,
            southern Sikkim. The Bhutia people lived at the the northern end of this region.
            Over time the Magars became very powerful and made the northern Bhutia their vassals.
            Sintoo Sati Sheng ruled in a very despotic manner, and the Bhutia conspired to 
            assassinate him. Sheng's queen took revenge and poisoned 1000 Bhutia people at
            a place now called Tong Song Fong, meaning "where a thousand were murdered". 
            The Bhutia later drove the Magars out, forcing them to again migrate further south.
            As part of this migration, one group moved towards the Okhaldhunga region, and another
            group seems to have returned to the east. No dates are given. </p><br>
