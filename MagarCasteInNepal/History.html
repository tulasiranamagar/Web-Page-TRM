                  <p>The first written history about the Magar people dates as far back as 1100 CE. The Magars are one of the oldest 
                    known tribes in  Nepal. Their ancient homeland was known as Magwar Bisaya, later called Magarat.
                    Magarat bordered from Marsyangdi river to the Pyuthan area during that time. The Magars prospered at such 
                    a level during that period that this part of the country was divided into twelve kingdoms/thams 
                    (Barah Magarant or twelve magarat) each under its own ruler-the members of each supposedly being of common 
                    extraction in the male line. Some records show these twelve areas as being Arghak, Khachi, Gulmi, Isma, Musikot, 
                    Ghiring, Rising, Bhirkot, Paying, Garhung, Dhor and Satung. Among them, the most powerful kings were those of Gumli, 
                    Argha, Khachi. Broadly speaking, the twelve Magarat consisted of present-day Argha, Khanchi, Gulmi, Isma, Musikot, Ghiring, 
                    Baldengadhi, Rudrapurgadhi, Deuchuli,Tanahang/Tanu-hyula (Tanahu), Kanhu, Ligligkot, Gorkhakot, (Bahakot), Targhakot (Takukot), 
                    and Makawanpur, areas. Similary, Athara(eighteen) Magarat consisted of the following regions: Dhurkoi(Gulmi), 
                    Gharkoi(Arghakhachi), Paiya(Parbat), Sinkhang (Myagdi), Narikoi (Pyuthan), Balungbang (Pyuthan), Jangkoi (Rolpa), 
                    Rukumkoi (Rukum), Chhilikoi (Dang), Bhaba (Dailekh), Borekoi (Jajarkot), Tarakoi (Dolpa), Timarkoi (Jumla), Jural (Doti), 
                    Bunkot, Bahrakot, Lu Nanya (Dadeldhura) and Rupal (Dadeldhura).</p>

            <h3>Language and Script</h3>

                  <p>Main articles: Kham Language, Magar Language, and Kaike Language of the 2,013,498 Magar population in Nepal, 
                    about 810,315 speak Magar language as their mother tongue while the rest speak Nepali as their mother tongue. 
                    The western inhabitants of Nepal did not speak the language in the past. But recently, almost everyone has 
                    started learning the language. The Magar languages are rooted in the Bodic branch of the Tibetan family.</p><br>

                  <p>The Magar language, Magar Kura, is spoken in two major dialects and a number of sub dialects reflecting 
                     the geographic distribution of the group. The Western Magars of Rapti Zone speak Magar Kham language. 
                     In Dolpa District, Magars speak Magar Kaike language. Magar Dhut language speakers are all Magar clans 
                     residing in Twelve Magarat. Similarly Magar Kham language speakers are all Magar clans from Eighteen Magarat. 
                     Magar Kaike language speakers are all Magar clans in Karnali zone.</p><br>

                  <p>Magar Akkha or scripts are used in Sikkim as a Magar language script. Many scholars including MS Thapa have 
                    been in forefront to implement the Akkha script to write Magar language in Nepal. New generations have been 
                    learing it. Akkha script is said to be closely associated with Brahmi script.</p><br><br>
